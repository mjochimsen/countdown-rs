//! `countdown` permits the user to create a countdown thread which
//! decrements to zero. The thread keeps track of the how far the
//! countdown has progressed, and also how much time it has taken. The
//! current state of the countdown can be retrieved from another thread.
//!
//! `countdown` is designed for use with long running tasks which need to
//! provide some degree of feedback regarding how far they have progressed,
//! and how much longer the work is likely to take.
//!
//! `countdown` can be accessed across thread boundaries, and may be
//! updated by multiple threads (for monitoring concurrent task loads).
